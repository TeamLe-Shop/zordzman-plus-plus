/// This namespace provides the means for representing game state using the
/// entity-component-system (ECS) model.
///
/// As implied by the name, this model defines three core concepts:
///
/// Entities
/// --------
/// Entities are dumb collections of data. Related data is grouped together
/// into components. Each entity is uniquely identifiable throughout the game's
/// existence via a numeric ID.
///
/// Components
/// ----------
/// Components are the logical grouping of entity data fields. Components are
/// owned by entities, and each component represents a 'trait' exhibited by the
/// parent entity. For example, there may be an component type for holding
/// positional data (a.k.a. X, Y coordinates). An entity with a position
/// component can be said to exhibit the 'positional' trait.
///
/// Each component type should be uniquely identifiable among all over
/// component types by a string ID.
///
/// Systems
/// -------
/// Systems are routines that act on these traits. They are responsible for
/// implementing the 'game logic'. Each system is called once for each
/// simulation cycle.
///
/// Systems may register an interest in entities that only possess certain
/// components. For example, a trivial system may wish to only be applied to
/// entities with the aforementioned position component. This system then
/// might then increment the coordinates each time it is invoked.
