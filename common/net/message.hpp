/// Handle sending and receiving JSON-encoded messages over a socket.
///
/// This class operators on a TCP socket to communicate whitespace-separated,
/// JSON-encoded messages. Each 'message' is a JSON object with two fields.
/// The `type` field is a string that identifies the type of the message and
/// is used to map messages to callbacks.
///
/// Secondly, the `entity` field can be any JSON type. A string, a number or
/// even a complex data structure comprised of multiple nested objects and
/// arrays. Anything is valid in this field. However the structure of the
/// `entity` field is implied by the value of the `type` field. As such, all
/// messages of a given type should conform to a defined structure.
///
/// Note that this class provides no mechanism for validating message entities
/// so message handlers must implement that themselves.
///
/// @code{.json}
/// {"type": "example", "entity": ...}
/// @endcode
///
/// As mentioned above, this class introduces a concept of callbacks/handlers.
/// These are void-returning callable objects that are called in response to
/// messages of certain types being received. Handlers must be registered on
/// `MessageProcessor` instances via `MessageProcessor::addHandler`.
///
/// This class is generic and can deal with handlers with any signature by
/// specifying the handler signature in the type declaration. For example:
///
/// @code
/// net::MessageProcessor<int, std::string>
/// @endcode
///
/// Handlers for the above message processor will accept an `int` and
/// `std::string` argument. However, as well as this, there are two implicit
/// leading arguments. The first is a pointer to the `MessageProcessor` that
/// the handler is registered on and the second is the message entity field
/// as a `json11::Json` (for which the `MessageEntity` typedef is provided
/// for convenience). Therefore, a handler for the above message processor
/// would look like:
///
/// @code
/// typedef net::MessageProcessor<int, std::String> Processor;
///
/// void handler(Processor *processor,
///              net::MessageEntity entity, int first, std::string second) {
///       processor->send("echo", entity);
///  }
///
/// Processor processor(...);
/// processor.addHandler("example", handler);
/// processor.dispatch(5, "foo");
/// @endcode
///
/// The handlers can use the processor pointer in order to `send` responses.
///
/// There is a slight variation on handlers which are referred to as '*muted
/// handlers*'. Muted handlers are the same as regular handlers except they
/// don't accept the initial pointer to the processor instance, therefore they
/// are unable to `send` responses. Continuing from the above example:
///
/// @code
/// void muted_handler(net::MessageEntity entity,
///                    int first, std::string second) {
///     // Mmph mphna mprh.
/// }
///
/// processor.addHandler("example", muted_handler);
/// processor.dispatch(5, "foo");
/// @endcode
