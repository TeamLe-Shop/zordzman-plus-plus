class Client(threading.Thread):
    """The Zordzman network client.

    This is a client which runs in its own thread that handles the
    socket-level communication between Zordzman and a remote server. It
    provides the API for the C++ wrapper (``net::Client``) which lets messages
    be recieved and sent from C++.

    Each client maintains two message 'pipelines'. These pipelines are
    responsible for validating messages that are passed into them. The ingress
    pipeline holds messages which are said to be moving 'towards' the C++
    layer. E.g. messages from the server.

    The egress pipeline is for messages in the opposite direciton, as in, away
    from the C++ layer towards the server.

    Each message has two components: a type and an entity. The type, primarily
    identified by its name as a string describes the structure of the entity.
    The entity is the main content of the message and are exposed as plain
    Python dictionaries.

    The ingress and egress pipelines will only accept messages which are of
    a type that has been registerd with each respective pipeline. Hence, if
    a message is received which the client doesn't know about it will be
    discarded and will never reach the C++ layer. The same applies in the
    opposite direction -- the C++ layer cannot attempt to send a message
    the pipeline doesn't know how to process.

    As well as acting as convenient containers for messages, pipelins also
    allow Python functions to subscribe to certain message types. These
    subscribers are called when a message is recieved of the matching type.

    Furthermore, message subscribers can 'silence' a message which prevents
    them moving through the pipeline any further. This means pipelines can
    be used for communication between the C++ and Python levels without the
    worry of messages leaking out to the remote server.

    In fact, this is how the C++ level tells the client where to connect to,
    by sending it a ``zm:connect`` message. And it's the same for
    disconnecting where a ``zm:disconnect`` message is sent instead.
